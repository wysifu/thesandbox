runnin tests all day to Dilla and araab
didnt make it responsive or anything. i am planning to create this more thoroughly in django but i wanted to work a few concepts out 
before moving on to django and its own problems. 

the things i wanted to test were mostly ui stuff.. css flexbox for getting the gallery laid out how i envisioned, background image work too.

just a basic walk through of how batman begins or the dark knight will look or maybe its jerry mcwire decentral city
